# Introduction

## What is Renegade?

Renegade is a new type of decentralized exchange, an on-chain dark pool.

In contrast to all current DEXes, Renegade is designed to give you **universal
trade privacy**. That means that your trading activity is completely obscured
from all third-parties, both before a trade occurs and after it is filled. No
one except you will know the details of your balances or trades.

Renegade solves many problems in current DeFi spot markets, ultimately giving you
better prices:

1. *Pre-trade privacy*. Before your trade is matched, no one can see any
   details of your order. Larger trades that would normally move the market
   when detected in the mempool can now be filled privately.
2. *Post-trade privacy*. After an order is filled, only the counterparty learns
   what assets were swapped. This prevents third-parties from tracking and
   copying your trading strategies.
3. *Zero MEV*. Since validators only ever see zero-knowledge proofs of valid
   swaps, there is no ability for block producers to front-run, back-run, or
   sandwich your trades.

For a high-level overview of the system and to see how Renegade solves all three
of these problems, ultimately leading to better order execution, check out the
[Exchange Overview](/docs/exchange-overview/dark-pool-explainer) and [Trade
Privacy and MEV](/docs/exchange-overview/mev).

For more details on the network structure, check out the [Network
Architecture](/docs/exchange-overview/trade-lifecycle), and for cryptographic
details on our zero-knowlege and multi-party computation schemes, check out the
[Cryptography Details](/docs/exchange-overview/cryptography).

For the most precise description of the protocol, see the detailed
[Whitepaper](/docs/exchange-overview/whitepaper).

## Implementation Status

Renegade is under active development, and is currently building on StarkNet.  A
public testnet is expected in late 2022, and you can follow-along with our
progress on our [public GitHub](https://TODO) and our [Twitter](https://TODO).

We recently [raised a $3.7M seed round](https://TODO) from Dragonfly and Naval,
so if youâ€™re interested in working on the hardest problems in ZK, MPC, game
theory, and low-level performance programming, please [shoot us a
message](https://TODO) and/or [check out our jobs page](https://TODO).
